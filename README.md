# RabbitMQ Learning Project

This repository contains a series of microservices designed to demonstrate and explore the use of RabbitMQ as a message broker for  decoupled, scalable, and efficient inter-service communication.

## Technologies
- **RabbitMQ** – message broker for communication between services
- **Node.js (Express)** – Framework used to build the microservices
- **SQLite** – Lightweight database, used minimally to focus on RabbitMQ's functionality
